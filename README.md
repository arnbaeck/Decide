        Everyone contributed in creating issues for each of the LIC's, the code skeleton and complete unit test. A code skeleton was created, using live share where everyone contributed in the same file. Everyone experimented and researched with gridle to create a build and version control through GitHub. All of the LIC's where distributed.
